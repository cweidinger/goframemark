# Framemark

Back in 2014, I was interested in how different web frameworks compared to each other on a variety fo dimmensions. I spent a few nights learning golang by doing some data munging on the following sources: github stars and forks, redmonk language ranking, and Techempower's Web Framework Benchmarks. The output is a fragement of javascript that I included in an angular 1 app to visualize the results.
 
4 years later, I'm not even sure if I could get the thing to run but I wanted to put this on github so that I don't have to maintain a private repo.
